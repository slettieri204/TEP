# TEP
This was an unpaid project where I volunteered to build a web application for The Education Partnership (TEP) in Pittsburgh 
TallyHQ is a web application for The Education Partnership in Pittsburgh that allows public school teachers to shop at the warehouse for donated school supplies.
It was written in django and deployed using Heroku and AWS using a postgres backend database.
The login page for the app is here: http://gentle-crag-33999.herokuapp.com/
Only teachers with a valid email address can log in.
This App was created primarily for use with a tablet as the teachers shop in the warehouse.
